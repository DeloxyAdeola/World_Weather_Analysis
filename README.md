# World_Weather_Analysis
The purpose of this challenge was to improve our app so that it contains weather descriptions along with our weather data. Customers will be able to use input statements to filter the data for their weather preferences, which will be used to identify potential travel destinations and nearby hotels. Lastly, we created both a travel itinerary and travel map as well as a marker layer map.
Results
This map takes the information gained in the weather database and uses Google Maps API to plot different travel destinations with a hotel at each location. Information such as weather description, temperature, and countries are listed.
This takes the search information from the search folder and uses directions API to create a vacation itinerary. For my example, I used four cities spread throughout UY
We added popup markers with information on the cities included in the itinerary.
what i created and with the measures and analtysis done, the trip will be cost saving for my customers.
